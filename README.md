## Project Overview
W. Avy wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results
The analysis of the temperature data for June and December shows that:
- The max temperature in June is 85 degrees and the max temperature in December is 83 degrees.

-The minimum teperature in June is 64 degrees and the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees.

-On average the temperature in June is 74.9 degrees and in Decemeber the average temperature is 71.0 degrees.
    
 

## Challenge Summary
Overall there isn't a major difference in temperature during the summer and winter months which would make for the ideal spot for a surf and ice cream shop. On average there is only about a 4 degree difference in temperature between June and December. Vistors from the colder states coming in to Oahu are going to still be enjoying that climate and surf activities compared to the fridged temperatures from the states in December.
